# myopic_search
In this project I focus on different types of nodes (depending on centrality) and study whether centrality affects searchability. In other words, if central (or important) nodes are easier to search in networks. By the term searchability it’s possible to imagine the fact, that there exist underlying distributed way to route messages through the network. I am experimenting with Kleinberg’s greedy myopic search algorithm in the networks which simulate aspects of real-world networks with goal to find out if this algorithm is more likely to find shortest paths between important nodes or between not important nodes (or between a mixture of nodes).
